## My process

My process of this challenge was very very challeging but i'm glad i struggled to pull through.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This process was really helpful to me as i learned more about HTML & CSS. Just a few of it include;

 Adding an avatar and username on an html document.

```HTML
<div class="avatar">
    <img src="assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="" />
    <p>Greg Hooper</p>
</div>
```
Adding a hover effect to an html element.

```css
h1:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

*Setting padding, margins and borders. These areas are really challenging to me but i look forward in grabbing it.


### Useful resources

- [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This helped me in setting the hover effect to the h5 element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
